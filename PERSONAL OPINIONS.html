    What are my thoughts? I have played this game for 4 years (5 once March hits!). I played near the end of Splatoon 2's lifespan, but I was (and still am!) fully invested in the game.
    I have bought Splatoon 3 the day it released (September 9th, 2022) and it was a major upgrade to two. 
    Splatoon 2 was amazing, it brought the species of Octarians as a character the player can play as, all thanks to the DLC you could buy for the game (Octo Expansion).
    Two brought in Off the Hook, a idol duo. One is based off a Pygmy Squid, and the other is based off an octopus. Having an octopus as an idol changed everything.
    The octoling idol was there before the dlc even happened.
    The vibe of Splatoon 2 was amazing, and so were the splatfests (Splatfests are events that happen about once a month and you get to choose between two options based upon the given question. Example: "Which do you like more? Knights or Wizards?". The event lasts Friday evening to Sunday evening, and once it is done the 
    results for who won take about an hour. Whichever team wins well, wins, but they also get +2 seasnails which you can use for any gear in game.)! The hub called Inkopolis Square was actually based off of New York's Time Square! The first games hub, called Inkopolis Plaza was based off of Shibuya. Most specifically Shibuya Crossing.
    Splatoon 2's hero mode or story mode was about almost the same as Splatoon 1's story/hero mode as people said. However, the results of who won the final splatfest in Splatoon 1 actually AFFECTED the story for Splatoon 2! The last Splatfest was "Callie v.s. Marie", the idols for Splatoon 1. I would share more, but I do not want to spoil it for anyone.
    What's funny is, they did this yet again! For Splatoon 2's finalfest, it was where you decided what world you would want to live in. It was "Chaos v.s. Order". And once again, it affected Splatoon 3 as a result. Though, this time it was based on the atmosphere
    of Splatoon 3. Chaos won the fest, and once Splatoon 3 had it's previews, trailers, and testfires, we could see how the world was. It was chaos, and so were the outfits. All of it SPOKE chaos. I find it really cool how they have done this! We are getting a dlc again early 2024, but for Splatoon 3. And it seems that the Splatoon 2 finalfest also affected the dlc as the world
    is in an orderly state, even the name for the DLC is called "Side Order"!
    But enough of DLC talk, how does SPLATOON 3 seem like?
    Splatoon 3 is fun, it has TONS of upgrades compared to 2. From visuals to game mechanics, it changed everything. The visuals are AMAZING compared to 2, you can do a thing called "Squid-Roll" (Tilt your left joycon and press B at the same time), you can "Surge" and jump up walls higher (Holding B on a wall), and so much more!
    They introduced THREE TEAMS for Splatfest now! And they also introduced TRI-COLOR! Tri-color is like turf war, but all three teams are playing! There is defense, where it is 4 people on the team. The protect the ULTRA SIGNAL in the middle of the map. OFFENSE has to get the Ultra Signal in order to get these sprinkler type things to ink more turf, as it is important.
    There are two people on both offenses, but they have to work TOGETHER in order to win. So essentially, it is still a 4v4. HOWEVER, anyone can win even if both Ultra Signals have been achieved. I find it fun, depending upon which map Tr-Color is on!
    They have a DLC where you can travel to SPlatoon 1's main hub too! This DLC also provides SIDE ORDER, which is releasing early 2024! Splatoon 3 is really fun, they include so many things the other two titles didn't have and the aesthetic and graphics are so pleasing to the eyes, even the models! I fully reccommend it.
    
    Of course though, there are some cons. Currently, a lot of people are playing Splatoon 3 more than the other titles. But the game seems to have bugs. In the beginning, there were TONS of connection issues. Currently, the connection issues have been somewhat fixed and are not that frequent anymore. With Tri-Color, matching blows if you're on the 
    most popular team. You get put into mirror matches CONSTANTLY, and the points don't even count! However, in regualr turf war battles even if you get mirror matches the points do count? I wish they fixed this. RIGHT NOW, they have a problem too.
    Recently, Big Run happened (there is a "job" you can have in game, and Big Run is where the enemies, or the salmonids, invade a map from the game and we have to defeat them so they can leave. It is a dangerous job as stated by Grizzco Industries, the job you work at.)
    and at the end of Big Run you're given a prize. They fixed the prize system to have set goals to get specific trophies, such as regular, bronze, silver, and gold. They give out little statues in those colors as a reward.
    People who achieved 143+ eggs were supposed to get a GOLD STATUE, I was too sicne I achieved that goal! But I (and many others) got a BRONZE statue. They have been trying to fix this, and they just gave us an update for it (as of 12/10/2023 as I am typing this) a few days ago but it did not fix the issue.
    Nintendo has been trying to fix it. Thankfully this game is still getting patches+balance patches so thats the good part at most!

    OVERALL, I still reccommend this game. Since I only played two and three, I still think it's fun and enjoyable. I met so many kind people, had so much fun, and I enjoy it all.
    I fully reccommend this to anyone who likes third person shooters and such, every battle you have is exciting since you don't know what will happen!
